			<strong>Potted History</strong>
    		<p>My name is Jamie, and I was born in England,a littl while ago. While a youth, my family and I moved hundreds of miles north to Scotland.  Most of my schooling was undertaken in East Lothian.  After which, as a young adult living in Edinburgh, I held several diverse jobs, none of which were what I wished to spend my working life pursuing.</p>
    		<p>A few years later I moved further north and got married.  Eventually I returned to Edinburgh where my 2 daughters were born.  Ultimatly, their mother and I devorced. For several years I have been living in Musselburgh.  In 2017, I enroled on a HND at Edinburgh College in <a href="ec.html">Computer Networking</a>.</p>
    		<p>In 2018, against all odd, as I had thought, I eventually remarried and later our baby son was born. In 2019, I successfully attained my HND in Computer Networking.  Later that year I matriculated at Edinburgh Napier University, to study <a href="enu.html">Cybersecurity and Forensics</a>.<p>
